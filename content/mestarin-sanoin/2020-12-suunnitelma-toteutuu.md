Suunnitelma toteutuu

Suurella mielenkiinnolla Hierarkia tarkkailee nyt maailman tapahtumien kulkua. Niin monilukuisia ja niin moninaisia ne ovat, että vain harjaantunut silmä ja ymmärtäväinen mieli saattavat nähdä niiden yhteydet ja siten käsittää niiden pohjalta löytyvän logiikan sekä väistämättömyyden
It is with the greatest interest that Hierarchy watches the events now unfolding in the world. So many and so diverse are these happenings that only the practised eye and understanding mind can make the connections and see, therefore, their underlying logic and inevitability. Without such broader vision, humanity is, at best, bewildered, at worst, fearful and dismayed. When all seemed set fair for prosperity and peace, the prospect now looks bleak: eco- nomic hardship and growing ethnic strife add their daily quota of pain to perennial starvation and injustice. What has gone wrong, many ask, faith and courage shaken by events. When will the new time start, as promised?

This, a time of transition, is inevitably one of difficulty. All that we are witnessing results from the impact of great energies and forces which, playing upon humanity, call forth their various re- sponses. These, unfortunately, are not uniform and homogeneous but are conditioned by separate interests, ambitions and desires – individual and national. Hence the plethora of nationalistic move- ments and ethnic demands now coming to the fore.

Looked at from Our viewpoint, these demands are the legitim-
ate but distorted reaction to the energies engendering the desire for freedom which now saturate the world – applauded when acted upon to overthrow an oppressive political regime; condemned, and rightly so, as the instigator of fratricide, atrocity and war.

There exists the notion that, as the “inner government” of the planet, Hierarchy is in control of all events, large and small. This certainly is not the case. Nor could it ever be, without the infringe- ment of men’s free will. The task of Hierarchy is to implement the Plan of God through “The Centre which we call the Race of Men.” This must be done while respecting, at all times, man’s divine free will. **Thus, look not for perfection in the working out of the Plan from day to day or year to year. The long term aim is assured, of that there is no doubt. Man alone dictates the vagaries of the path by which it proceeds.**

Soon you will see a lessening of the tensions which today grip the world. Events are nearing a crisis which will resolve these dis- parate forces and allow saner viewpoints to be heard. Economic necessity is forcing even the richest nations to think more globally and more in line with group need. Soon, the straits caused by greed will force a rethinking of economic theory and practice and lead the way to a fairer world. This day is not “just around the corner” but not too far off. Fear not, the Plan has not gone wrong.

The Plan, indeed, works out.
