summary: "Lainaus: Jokainen aika tuo maailmaan uusia ja tuntemattomia voimia, jotka pikku hiljaa vaikuttavat ihmisiin ja aikaansaavat vastineen. Näin on tänään, kun ihmiset hakevat hämärässä uuden ajan energioiden vaatimaa suuntaa."

The future beckons
by the Master —, through Benjamin Creme

From time to time, I have spoken of the need to inculcate the spirit of sharing whereby the world’s resources can be more equitably distributed. This would lead to a reduction of tension and of incalculable human suffering. It would also bring about a revitalization of the life and of the economies of the already developed nations. The life-blood of the planet must circulate. The stagnant economies of the richer nations can only be galvanized into motion through the recognition that the poorer nations, too, have a right to live and to enjoy a reasonable standard of life. Only sharing can make this so.
Daily, the evidence mounts to show men that the world is One, that humanity is an organism whose well-being depends on the health of every part, and that to ignore the signs of danger and of disease is no longer possible or wise. Many now see this and call for justice but only the cry of awakened humanity will suffice to shift the Powers from their positions of greed.
Soon, the world will know for certain that men must share or perish. Maitreya will lose no time in bringing home to all, this truth. He will show men that the world belongs to everyone – rich and poor, powerful and dispossessed, white and coloured. He will make clear the need for concerted action to solve the problems which confront man today, and will point the way to their solution. Calling upon all men to accept the need for change, He will quicken the aspiration and focus the will of men everywhere to see justice done. Thus will He unite all those who seek the establishment of better forms through which the divinity of man can be expressed; and from that multitude will rise a cry unlike aught heard before on this Earth, a cry for justice and truth, freedom and peace.
Then will the leaders respond and, in growing momentum, this world will be transformed. Thus will it be; thus will Maitreya lay the foundations of the new civilization based on sharing and love. 
Can you not feel the new rhythm which is entering your lives? Who can ignore the new impulse which quickens men to action? All will be remade, and soon the darkness will give way to revealing light.
All who can respond to the needs of the time will find a place. This the Law of Service guarantees. No-one who longs to serve need fear lack of work or purpose nor the willing guidance of experienced hands. We shall help you to restore this world to health and shall work as brothers at your side, clearing away the debris of the past.
Soon the world will see great changes taking place and will know that the new age has begun. The old is passing away and the future beckons mankind. No-one need fear that future for it holds for man the promise of his divine heritage, and the establishment everywhere of the Will of God.
Serve, and realize that future for yourselves and your brothers. Serve, and know you are working in unison with God’s Will. Serve gladly and wisely, and enter into freedom and joy. [March 1984]
